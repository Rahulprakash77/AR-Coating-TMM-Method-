### Anti-reflective coatings:
An anti-reflection coating is a thin film applied to optical surfaces to minimize reflection and enhance transmission of light. Typically composed of dielectric materials, such coatings work by creating destructive interference between reflected waves. This interference reduces glare, ghost images, and increases contrast. Anti-reflection coatings are widely used in eyeglasses, camera lenses, and display screens. The design of these coatings is optimized for specific wavelengths to reduce reflections over a broad spectrum. They improve optical performance by allowing more light to pass through and minimizing unwanted reflections. The effectiveness of anti-reflection coatings is influenced by factors such as film thickness and refractive index

### Multilayers thin film and TMM method:
Multilayer thin films are structures composed of multiple layers of different materials, each with specific optical properties, thicknesses, and refractive indices. These films are designed to manipulate the transmission, reflection, and absorption of light for various applications in optics and photonics. The construction and optimization of multilayer thin films involve careful consideration of the properties of each layer and their arrangement. The transfer-matrix method (TMM) is a computational technique used to analyze the optical properties of multilayer thin films. It involves calculating the propagation of electromagnetic waves through each layer of the film, taking into account the reflection and refraction at each interface. The TMM can be used to predict the reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance of light as a function of wavelength and incident angle.

### Deep Learning and Photonics:
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These networks, inspired by the human brain, can automatically learn hierarchical representations from data. Deep learning excels in tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and pattern detection. Training deep neural networks often requires large datasets and substantial computational resources. The deep learning architecture allows the model to automatically extract relevant features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. Popular deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, facilitate the development and training of complex neural network architectures.

Deep learning has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in various domains, including computer vision, speech processing, and autonomous systems. The success of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), has fueled its widespread adoption in artificial intelligence applications.

## Reinforcement learning in inverse design

### Inverse design using RL:
The last three paradigms of machine learning is RL . DeepMindâ€™s AlphaZero and AlphaStar are popular examples of this class of goal-oriented machine learning approaches. Those algorithms are able to play popular games such as chess, shogi and go, and have been even expanded to learn games just of them limited information, such in the case of AlphaStar Remarkably, after a few hours of training by playing games against itself, the agents were able to achieve a human level of competency, while only being told about the rules of the game.

The main idea of RL is based on training an agent to learn about the parameter space of an environment through its own experience, by means of combining exploration and exploitation with the maximization a given cumulative reward. This can be understood as, for instance, analogous to humans eating quality food, for a short-term reward we can enjoy the taste, and for a long-term reward we stay healthy. Short-term rewards can also be negative to discourage certain choices, akin to the bad taste of low-quality food. Interestingly, in contrast to some of the algorithms discussed in the previous sections, RL does not require the creation of an extensive dataset to train on, as the policy is learned through the experience of the rewards received by doing certain actions in certain states. The decisions are made sequentially using Markov decision processes. Markovian approaches are ubiquitous in physics and can be summarized by this simple statement â€œFuture is independent of the past given the presentâ€™, i.e. the current state includes all the information that has been learned from the past states.

The key components of how RL works are summarized below. We have provided a brief description of each of these components of other important concepts underlying RL and their connection to nanophotonic design problems:

Agent: An agent is a component that take actions on the environment.

Actions: Actions (A) are a set of possible ways that theagent can interact with the environment. In the inverse design in nanophotonics, they often correspond to changes in a physical parameter of the system (such as a geometrical parameter of material forming some part of the system). The actions are defined within the environment and can be limited in states where physical limits could be exceeded.

Environment: The environment is the parameter space that the agent explores and learns about. This could be a set of physical dimensions, materials or incident angles, to name just a few examples.


 State: The state (S) is the situation in which the agent exists at a specific moment in time. In nanophotonics, this can be understood as the current set of parameters that describe a given design (such as the material, height and radius of a nanorod in a metasurface for example).

Reward: The reward (R) is the feedback that the agent receives for taking a specific action in a specific state. These rewards are a way of evaluating the action taken by the agent in the given state. A good example of a reward would be the optical properties of the specific design, such as reflection, transmission or absorption.

Policy: The policy (Ï€) is the strategy that the agent learns about the environment. The agent uses it to determine what its next action will be.

Discount factor: The discount factor (usually denoted as Î³) is a real number between 0 and 1, which is multiplied by future rewards make those future rewards less fulfilling than immediate one. A discount factor of 1 would give future rewards the same worth as immediate ones, whereas a discount factor or 0 would only consider the immediate rewards. This is a hyperparameter of the algorithm that should be tuned for each application.

Value: The value (V) is the expected long-term reward (including the discount factor) for the current state while using the policy p (it is usually denoted by VÏ€(s)).

Q-value: Similar to V, the Q-value takes a chosen action (a) an extra parameter into account. Specifically, the Q-value (QÏ€(s, a)) takes the current state (s) and the chosen action (a) under the policy Ï€ and maps the state-action pairs to rewards.
